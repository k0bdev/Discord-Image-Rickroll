# Discord Image Rickroll
Simple server written in Express that allows you make images redirecting to rickroll

### What you'll need
- [Node.js (tested on v16.15.1)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- npm (can be any other package manager like yarn but then you need to install it manually)

### Instalation
Type command below:
```
npm i
# or different depending on manager e.g. "yarn install" for yarn
```
### Usage
You start server by typing:
```
node .
# or
npm start
# or other command depending on manager (e.g. "yarn start")
```
Now you can share link with others:
`https://<domain>/attachment/<random snowflake>/<random snowflake>/<random filename>.png`
TIP: Best way to use it is by uploading it on some VPS (like replit) with discord-like link.
### [Configuration](/CONFIGURATION.md)
### Forks
If you want to fork it then there's no problems, i'll probably not gonna update it so often because it doesn't have so many functionalities that might break within time.
And if you think it's a virus then that's why it is on github, you can check code whenever you want!
